## ⚠️ TOP 3 IMPROVEMENT OPPORTUNITIES

### 1. **Content Authenticity (HIGH PRIORITY)**
**Current State:** Using Font Awesome icon placeholders for team photos, partner logos, client testimonials

**Recommended Actions:**
- Replace placeholder icons with professional photography
- Add 3-5 detailed case studies with real client data and metrics
- Film 3-5 video testimonials (60-90 seconds each)
- Use real partner logos (AWS, Microsoft, Odoo, etc.)

**Expected Impact:** 30-40% increase in credibility and conversion rate

---

### 2. **Lead Capture Optimization (HIGH PRIORITY)**
**Current State:** ROI calculator shows results immediately without capturing email

**Recommended Actions:**
- Add email capture before showing detailed calculator results
- Move calculator to hero CTA (currently mid-page)
- Fix trust badges showing "0" on page load (animation delay issue)
- Simplify CTA hierarchy (too many competing options)

**Expected Impact:** 50-70% increase in lead generation

---

### 3. **Technical Performance (MEDIUM PRIORITY)**
**Current State:** GSAP animation library not loading from CDN, causing fallback to CSS

**Recommended Actions:**
- Self-host GSAP library or improve CSS animation fallbacks
- Implement inline critical CSS for faster initial render
- Add Schema.org structured data for better SEO
- Launch content marketing engine (blog, 2-3 posts/week)

**Expected Impact:** 15-20% improvement in page speed and SEO ranking
